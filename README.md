# Curriculum

## How to use this curriculum

### Core Path

The following sections form the essential foundation of the discipline. Study them **in this exact order** to develop a coherent general understanding of what folklore is, how folklorists think, and how the field works:

1. I. Foundations of Folklore Studies  
2. II. History and Theory of Folkloristics  
3. III. Methods, Ethics, and Documentation  
4. IV. Core Folklore Genres  

These four sections (I–IV) give you the basic concepts, historical context, theoretical toolkit, research methods, and major categories of folklore. Finish them first, in sequence, before moving to anything else. 

### Specialization Tracks

After completing sections I–IV, you have several directional paths you can choose from, depending on your interests. These are **not** required for a general understanding, but they allow you to go deeper in specific areas:

- V. Regional, Ethnic, and Indigenous Traditions  
  (focus: folklore across cultures, places, and peoples)

- VI. Applied and Public Folklore  
  (focus: how folklore is used outside the university – museums, festivals, heritage work, public programs)

- VII. Contemporary and Digital Folklore  
  (focus: folklore in modern life, cities, media, internet, and popular culture)
